## About Blarg

[Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=blarg)
has this definition of _Blarg_:

> _Blarg is a unique word, being the only word that not only means anything
you want it to, or is used to show disinterest or boredom, but also is
the only word that thousands upon thousands of people have claimed to
have made up but has been around since man discovered they could use
tools. Hobo Dave and Raymond Donn are amongst those who claim to have
created the word, as well as some wierd dude called John who worked in
the Games Workshop in Falkirk. I have also been known to use the word
frequently in the past. I suppose, the true use of this word is to fill
a gap in a sentence where appropriate. If a stoned person says "blarg",
it is usually used to replace a word they cannot think of, or which they
have forgotten._
