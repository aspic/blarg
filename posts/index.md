# Welcome to this Blarg
I just figured I needed a static site generator (hah!), but when
looking for suitable software, they were all written in the wrong
programming languages. Hey, I don't want to install Ruby on Rails, and
why are people still using PHP? ;-)

## So I rolled my own
Using Perl and some neat modules!

	This is a code block?

## Why?
Cuz, perl!
